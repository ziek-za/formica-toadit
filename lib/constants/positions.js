You love looking for patterns in both technical and social problems. You get a kick out of identifying trends and spotting a niche with needs. You\u2019re interested in how communities function and what you can do to build healthier ones. You have excellent verbal &amp; written communication skills. You aspire to self-improvement and are eager to learn outside your comfort zone. You slice through community politics with the eloquence and grace of a finely sharpened, skilled blade. You\u2019re not afraid to challenge the status quo and are unsatisfied with mediocre results.</p>\n\n<p>This position requires you to question every idea and test every assumption and be brave with your creative thinking. Your interest means you love meeting developers around the world; it means you\u2019re genuine and helpful in this regard.</p>\n\n<p>WHAT YOU&#39;LL BE DOING:</p>\n\n<p>Helping Developers - You will be the most loved evangelist in the world. Community support is often an afterthought \u2013 for you it\u2019s your first thought.

You\u2019ll be given the freedom and the fuel to hack on projects and write modules, gems, libraries or APIs. You\u2019ll also have time to work on creative, fun ideas for novelty applications (think Brooklyn Hipster Company Generator) to surprise and delight your peers in the community.</p>\n\n<p>Creating useful content - The crux of your skills is that you are an excellent writer who can distill complicated concepts to their very essence. You\u2019ll be the face of our videos. You\u2019ll blog, find the best sources of cutting edge news for your community,, and hangout on social. You can put together an awesome presentation and have at least considered taking up photography or design as a hobby. You know that attention to detail makes an impact.</p>\n\n<p>Participating in events - Evangelism is more than just going to events and talking about your product. A good evangelist is an active participant in events: you share ideas, give feedback, and build the community. You talk with a passion about technology and know that in today\u2019s world you\u2019re constantly on camera, and there\u2019s a good chance the video will go viral and you\u2019ll end up being asked to give a TED Talk. Show love, be positive, be inspiring.</p>\n\n<p>WHAT WE EXPECT YOU TO KNOW:</p>\n\n<p>Experience with Python (and with the Django framework) and/or Site Reliability Engineering experience preferred, but we\u2019re also interested in PHP, Go, Ruby, and JavaScript hackers too</p>\n\n<p>Experience blogging, tweeting, and writing technical articles</p>\n\n<p>Excellent communication and presentation skills: you explain technical concepts clearly and concisely</p>\n\n<p>Ability and willingness to travel is a must</p>\n\n<p>A passion for the tech industry and growing developer community</p>\n\n<p>A BA/BS in Computer Science, Cognitive Science, Engineering or equivalent </p>\n\n<p>Experience as a software engineerStrong understanding of Linux</p>\n\n<p>Strong experience with RESTful web services and building applications with APIs</p>\n\n<p>A strong web following is a plus</p>\n\n<p>Getting this job will feel like winning the lottery for you</p>\n\n<p>WHAT YOU&#39;LL BE DOING:</p>\n\n<p>You care about the direction of the web and the technologies we use to build it</p>\n\n<p>You continually return to the topic of how to create and maintain healthy communities for developers</p>\n\n<p>You spend a lot of time thinking about how to construct a helpful, engaging, and enriching learning environment for developers</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019re vocal in online and offline developer communities and figure you could get paid for it</p>\n\n<p>You love to travel</p>\n\n<p>You are excited about the future of DigitalOcean</p>\n\n<p>You get a rush out of inspiring and enabling others to be the best they can be</p>\n\n<p>WHAT YOU&#39;LL NEED TO SUBMIT:</p>\n\n<p>Some of your very own code (mandatory, no problems if it\u2019s not public i.e. if you\u2019ve done mostly proprietary work the last while)</p>\n\n<p>A writing sample (min 500 words, max 2000)</p>\n\n<p>A video of you teaching and/or public speaking (optional but encouraged)</p>\n\n<p>Products or projects you\u2019ve put your heart into</p>\n\n<p>Links to your blog or profile in online communities like GitHub, Quora, Twitter, Stack Overflow or \nHacker News</p>\n\n<p>Languages you are fluent in (linguistically and technically)</p>\n\n<p>Your resume, please</p>\n\n<p>WORKING AT DIGITALOCEAN:</p>\n\n<p>DigitalOcean pays 100% of the premium for health, dental and vision and 50% of the premium for dependents</p>\n\n<p>Competitive compensation including a 401k with up to 4% employer match</p>\n\n<p>Flexible vacation time</p>\n\n<p>Stock options</p>\n\n<p>Corporate Seamless account to keep your hunger at bay</p>\n\n<p>Monthly commuter expense and gym membership allowance</p>\n\n<p>Great office space located in the heart of SoHo</p>\n",
